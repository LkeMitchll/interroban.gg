## Design

Special thanks go to:

- [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com) has been a huge inspiration for design approach and many of the honest, open concepts I hope this site conveys. I will never not be jealous of Frank.
- [Matthew Smithâ€™s Website](https://matthewsmith.website/) Inspired this page, among others.
- [Julian](https://julian.digital) inspired the journal.
- [The Value of Multi-Typeface Design](https://medium.com/s/about-face/the-value-of-multi-typeface-design-ccd67227b0ee) by [Bethany Heck](https://heckhouse.com) made me think more about being less minimal about font selection.

## Development

This site is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) (11ty), hosted on
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), the content and data is pulled from
[last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Luke--Mitchell), [Savee](https://savee.it),
[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com), [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com),
[Literal](https://literal.club) and [GitHub](https://github.com/LkeMitchll).

The [Source Code](https://github.com/LkeMitchll/interroban.gg) is hosted on GitHub.

- The [The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com) inspired me to try Eleventy, and provided excellent advice.
- I am using the [CUBE CSS](http://cube.fyi) methodology for all the styling.
- I was also inspired by [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev). The minimal snippets are an excellent example that CSS is an art form.
- I combined [This tutorial](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/inline-css/) in the Eleventy docs with PostCSS for a simple, extendable style pipeline.
- The [Eleventy RSS plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/) avoided lots of RSS headaches.
- Piccalilli wrote a [simple tutorial](https://piccalil.li/quick-tip/create-json-feed-eleventy) on outputting JSON from Eleventy.
- I was also helped along the way by [tea-stack](https://github.com/mattwaler/tea-stack) and [eleventyone](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone).
- I was also heavily insipred by [Aleksandr Hovhannisyan](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/custom-markdown-components-in-11ty/) when I was working how to build sidenotes.
- Max Kohler wrote an excellent guide to implementing [per-post commit logs](https://www.maxkohler.com/posts/per-file-commit-history-with-eleventy/)
- I learned from [Ben White](https://benwhite.com.au) that Cloudflare exposes a very handy environment variable containing the latest commit SHA: [GitHub](https://github.com/d3v1an7/website-benwhite/blob/f4de367d3930a144bc6246948e006e53c239ef9b/src/_components/partial-last-commit.webc)

## Typography

My typographic system is made up of:

- [PicNic](https://velvetyne.fr/fonts/picnic/) from Velvetyne is used for display headings.
- [Taurus Grotesk](https://www.fostertype.com/retail-type/taurus-grotesk) from Foster Type is used as body copy, and some headings.
- [Signifier](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/signifier/) from Klim is used for larger headings.
- [Pitch](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/) from Klim is used for smaller text, and data.

This site has formerly used:

- [Blanco](https://www.fostertype.com/retail-type/blanco) from Foster Type was used as body copy, and some headings.
- [GT America Extended](http://gt-america.com) from Grilli Type was used for larger headings.
