## History

I grew up in a small coastal town in the east of England [1](#sn-1). Not much happens
in a town like that, but the beaches are nice. My choices at school were pretty
limited, my favourite subjects were Computing, Media Studies, and Art -
‘design’ wasn’t something anyone was familiar with. Regardless I loved building
things for screens, creating images, and writing. Eventually you’re told to
find a future career, something you can ‘do’ for the rest of your life. I was
determined that ‘something’ should be ‘something’ I’d like, and that would
include my hobbies. I eventually started researching this thing called Graphic
Design, it took me a while to work out what it was.

While aimlessly googling “What do graphic designers do” I found a small forum
of enthusiasts (the name of which I never remembered, if it still exists) who
were swapping images of their favourite pieces of design. One commenter posted
a blurry snapshot of what I’d eventually learn was ‘Watching Words Move’ [2](#sn-2)
It amazed me, it is simple, playful and expressive, constructed solely from
words, in a single typeface.

I studied Graphic Design at university, and was lucky to get a job straight
after, at a small, local design agency. I was working on branding, print design
and Wordpress sites for other local businesses. It's here that I started to
really become passionate about the web, and user interfaces.

A few years later, sat at my desk, I was again googling: “what do Service
Designers do?”, and “what do Product Designers do?”. I loved parts of Graphic
Design as a job, but my interest in User Experience, and User Interfaces had
been growing. It was an itch that couldn’t be scratched designing logos and
building small Wordpress sites. The empathy and considerate approaches of
Product Design, combined with strategy and process appealed to me.

A few _more_ years later I’m happiest doing a little bit of anything that takes
an idea and turns it into a working product or service. In my spare time
I tinker with new web technologies, read as much as I can about design, walk,
and fawn over photos of brutalist architecture [3](#sn-3).
