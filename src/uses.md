### Clothing

My approach to clothing is pretty simple, I always prefer clothing that is made to last, and if possible I buy as much good second-hand clothing as I can. If you ever meet me in person I'll probably be wearing:

- A flannel shirt from, that I've bought second hand from eBay. I like the quality of Portuguese made flannels.
- A pair of [Nudie Jeans](https://www.nudiejeans.com/). I like their policies of offering [free repairs and trade-ins](https://www.nudiejeans.com/sustainability/sustainable-products).
- I'll probably be wearing a beat-up pair of [Converse All-Stars](https://www.converse.com/shop/p/chuck-taylor-all-star-unisex-high-top-shoe/M9160.html?dwvar_M9160_color=black&styleNo=M9160&cgid=chuck-taylor-all-star-shoes) or [Solovair Astronaut](https://www.nps-solovair.com/collections/all/products/s6-969-bk-g?variant=19778886336576) boots.
- A t-shirt, my goto basic is a [Gildan Hammer](https://www.mygildan.com/store/us/browse/productDetailsPage.jsp?productId=H000).
- If I'm walking I'll likely be wearing my beloved [GoRuck GR1](https://www.goruck.com/products/gr1) backpack, which I will probably be able to pass down to my grand-children.
