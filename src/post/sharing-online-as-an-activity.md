[Christopher’s](https://www.chrbutler.com/2023-09-10) thoughts on sharing, and
engaging online are really close to my own feelings. Doing this type of stuff
is definitely an activity or a task for me, especially when it’s work related.
I also feel like I need to break down this type of task into something, small,
repeatable, and something that doesn’t need too much mental effort from me.
Like my [bookmarks](https://www.interroban.gg/bookmarks/).

I am also very much happy to avoid chasing large audiences or wealth by sharing
online my work online:
