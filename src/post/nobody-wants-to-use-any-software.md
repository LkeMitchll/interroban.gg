Jane makes some great points about how software just isn't the solution to the
problem we think it is, in '[Nobody wants to use any
software](https://www.characterworks.co/blog/nobody-wants-to-use-any-software)',
and how software can make everything worse for people. After all "Nobody wakes
up in the morning thinking, 'I want some software.'"
