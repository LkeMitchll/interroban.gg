[Andy's post](https://piccalil.li/blog/the-time-for-designers-to-learn-to-code-is-now/?ref=main-rss-feed)
is an excellent guide and list of resources, it's also one of the best
summaries of why you should at least understand how the things you build for
work, and some very good reasons to learn to code as a designer, it's an
ancient argument but in 2024 it might just make you stand out enough when some
of our work can be spat out in 30 seconds by AI.

> I think for some, learning to code is a good route for that.

Please give this a try if you're a new (or not so new) designer.
