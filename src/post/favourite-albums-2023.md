I don’t have a Spotify wrapped to share this year. So, in no particular order, my favourite albums of the year:

## boygenius – the record

I have followed the work of this supergroups members for a little while. When they come together they create something incredible. This album is dark, honest, and witty.

## Wednesday – Rat Saw God

I couldn’t quite describe the sound of Wednesday, I think the description on Apple Music sums them up nicely:

> Blending the great fuzzy guitars of shoegaze with a faint Southern twang and lyrics fixated on the traumas of small-town life...

This album is noisy and chaotic, with a great narrative.

## The Beths – Expert in a Dying Field

I have listened to The Beths since their first album, they have gone from strength to strength, producing some of the best power pop out there. Also, their tour blog ‘[Breakfast and Travel Updates](https://www.breakfastandtravelupdates.com/)’ is one of my favourite feeds to follow.

## Jess Williamson – Time Ain’t Accidental

I am not a fan of country music, especially all of that toxic macho, “I drive trucks, and love my country” bullshit. This album from Jess is different. I first heard of her when she teamed up with [Waxahatchee](https://waxahatchee.bandcamp.com) to form [Plains](https://plainsband.bandcamp.com/album/i-walked-with-you-a-ways) (another album I love, from last year). This album is poetic, modern, and romantic, expertly shaking off all those stereotypes of country music.

## The Murder Capital – Gigi’s Recovery

Gigi’s Recovery is grander and darker than The Murder Capital’s first album. ‘Return My Head’ is a a real thumper that I’d love to see live one day.

That’s it, see you next year.
