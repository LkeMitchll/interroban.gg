Like a almost everyone I work with I’m thinking a lot about how all this new fangled [AI stuff](https://chat.openai.com) will change my work. [Matthew offers the most level-headed metaphor](https://matthewstrom.com/writing/design-by-wire/) I’ve found so far:

> Just as fly-by-wire systems have made pilots more efficient (not redundant), AI and automation will make designers more effective.
>
> Imagine a design-by-wire system. The job of the designer is to indicate what they want the desired outcome to be. Like a pilot pushing the throttle to make the airplane accelerate, a designer could assemble a wireframe or configure a screen to enable a user to accomplish a task.

This is a refreshing break from the other hot takes that flip between unconditional praise and a terrifying dystopia.
