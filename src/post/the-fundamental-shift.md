Like [David](https://www.david-smith.org/blog/2023/06/12/new-post/) I think
itâ€™s going to be a long time before the interfaces I sometimes daydream about
will get close to reality, for me the [Vision Pro](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/)
is the first view into the future, which surprised me.

The design implications for these interfaces is really interesting. As the
lines between physical and digital blur, designers and developers will be
getting access to more powerful tools to build interfaces and experiences. We
are moving beyond controlling what happens on a flat surface, instead we will
be able to control a sophisticated view of the world around people. That feels
like a big responsibility.
