I'm currently thinking about writing case studies for my work, I didn't know
where to start, so I did what I do when starting any project, some research; I
needed to define what I think makes a good case study.

Here are my thoughts so far.

## Structure

I am a fan of detailed case-studies. It's important that the case study details
the project step-by-step, not only the final output but the actions taken along
the way.

Firstly, introduce the project, include: Who the client is. Why they approached
you. What problem they were facing. This adds historical context to the work
and why it was needed in the first place.

Next give an overview of the phases of the project for example:
[Discover, Define, Develop, Deliver][dddd]. Include what they meant to you for
this project.

The rest of the case study should document all the steps taken from the
beginning to the end, each step should tell the reader: what you did, how you
did it, why you did it, and the what you and others learned by doing it. Below
is a non-exhaustive list of steps I like to see, seeing at least 5 of them is a
good sign:

- Competitive research
- User research
- User testing
- Workshops & important meetings
- Sketches
- Moodboards
- Wireframes
- Prototypes
- Design system components

You may find it helpful to split the work into different features, meaning you
produce several mini case-studies instead.

## Images

Images are an important part of any case-study, in my opinion not as important
as the story, but still a big part if created with care.

Polish and attention to detail is good, but not the most important thing,
successful imagery needs to enhance the text it interrupts, as long as imagery
is relevant and easy to understand the polish can come second.

Any imagery should aid the content itself it's a good idea to keep relevant
images and text together. Try not to dominate the text with giant images that
overtake everything else, especially if they are decorative ^[I'm not keen on
mockups of phones floating in the air at funny angles, it makes it hard to see
the details.].

I like to see photographs of things happening, especially if you can show the
team working together on a problem.

When it comes to showing off the final product I prefer to see fewer images
that are interesting or innovative, rather than lots of images of another
run-of-the-mill login screen. Which interactions are you most proud of, and
why?

## Design

When designing how a case-study looks, less is more, any design decisions made
should elevate the content, avoid distracting decoration. That doesn't mean the
design should be boring, a well designed case-study should still engage the
reader.

Try to avoid treating every image same, context is important, for example
comparing images is easier when they are side-by-side. Loosening the grid can
add character and a sense of creative 'chaos' to a collection of early stage
sketches ^[The [Font Review Journal][frj] and the design notes for
[Blanco][blanco] do this beautifully.].

The typography should have a personality that does not shout over the top of
the content, but is capable of singing to an audience when needed. The
hierarchy should define sections, pauses and guide the reader effortlessly.

Colour should try not to distract from the content or draw the eye away from
important images, a carefully chosen colour palette can be helpful in telling
the story, but defaulting to neutral themes is sensible.

## Wrapping up

Once you get to the end summarise what the most important learnings and
failures were for *you* and the team. Remember that design work is never
'done', talk about what the next steps are going to be in the future.

Finally, please, please, link to the work in the wild, if it exists.

## Things to remember

Don’t be afraid to show work-in-progress, failed ideas, and other work that you
may not consider to be 100% successful or worthy of sharing publicly. I find
that being honest can show me more about a designer than pixel-perfect imagery,
after all nobody is perfect, and projects rarely go 100% to plan in the real
world. Somebody who can open up is willing to  demonstrate how they handle the
twists and turns that projects can take.

It's OK to talk about the things you *wish* you did during the project, or
might try next time, this tells me that you learn by mistakes, and constantly
learning.

It's OK to take some credit for things that you did not create as a sole
contributor, teamwork is important.

Don’t skip over 'invisible work', after all [thinking is work][dan].

Remember that this is *my* opinion of what a good case-study looks like. **If
you're using this post as guide to get a job please investigate what the
company you're applying for prefers to see.**
