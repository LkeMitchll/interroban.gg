Inspired by [Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/) the blog part of the [journal](/journal) will start getting more updates, I’m calling them ‘notes’, they are going to be shorter and focused on something interesting that I’ve read elsewhere recently.

I often read blog posts via [RSS](/post/rss-is-calm/), if I find a post really interesting I think that it makes sense to highlight it in some way, and maybe add some of my own thoughts too. This means I can write smaller posts more often, and it means I can highlight some of the great work that I see on my travels around the internet.

For now notes live in the same place as [all the other posts](https://github.com/LkeMitchll/interroban.gg/commit/eef6ffcdd03d3e92c5a68ec8924a442b97e1dcbd).
