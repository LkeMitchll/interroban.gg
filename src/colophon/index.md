## Impact

Approximately **{{ carbon.c }}g** of CO₂  is produced every time someone visits
this website. Which is cleaner than **{{ carbon.p }}%** of websites tested by
[websitecarbon.com](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/interroban-gg/).

## Design

Special thanks go to:

- [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com) has been a huge inspiration for design approach and many of the honest, open concepts I hope this site conveys. I will never not be jealous of Frank.
- [Matthew Smith’s Website](https://matthewsmith.website/) Inspired this page, among others.
- [Julian](https://julian.digital) inspired the journal.
- [The Value of Multi-Typeface Design](https://medium.com/s/about-face/the-value-of-multi-typeface-design-ccd67227b0ee) by [Bethany Heck](https://heckhouse.com) made me think more about being less minimal about font selection.
- [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com) has a great ethos about 'incrementally correct' websites.

## Development

This site is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) (11ty), hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), the content and data is pulled from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/lkemitchll?si=dPG3-TtUSdSL5lLczPEg_A), [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/Luke--Mitchell), and [GitHub](https://github.com/LkeMitchll). 

The [Source Code](https://github.com/LkeMitchll/interroban.gg) is hosted on GitHub. 

- The [The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com) inspired me to try Eleventy, and provided excellent advice.
- I am using the [CUBE CSS](http://cube.fyi) methodology for all the styling.
- I was also inspired by [SmolCSS](https://smolcss.dev). The minimal snippets are an excellent example that CSS is an art form.
- I combined [This tutorial](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/inline-css/) in the Eleventy docs with PostCSS for a simple, extendable style pipeline.
- The [Eleventy RSS plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/) avoided lots of RSS headaches.
- Piccalilli wrote a [simple tutorial](https://piccalil.li/quick-tip/create-json-feed-eleventy) on outputting JSON from Eleventy.
- I was also helped along the way by [tea-stack](https://github.com/mattwaler/tea-stack) and [eleventyone](https://github.com/philhawksworth/eleventyone).
- I was also heavily insipred by [Aleksandr Hovhannisyan](https://www.aleksandrhovhannisyan.com/blog/custom-markdown-components-in-11ty/) when I was working how to build sidenotes.
- Max Kohler wrote an excellent guide to implementing [per-post commit logs](https://www.maxkohler.com/posts/per-file-commit-history-with-eleventy/)

## Typography

My typographic system is made up of:

- [Blanco](https://www.fostertype.com/retail-type/blanco) from Foster Type is used as body copy, and some headings.
- [Signifier](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/signifier/) from Klim is used for larger headings. 
- [Pitch](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/pitch/) from Klim is used for smaller text, and data. 

This site has formerly used:

- [GT America Extended](http://gt-america.com) from Grilli Type was used for larger headings.
