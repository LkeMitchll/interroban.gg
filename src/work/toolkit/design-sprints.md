Over the years I have organised, facilitated and supported many design sprints, and their variants. At my last job I helped to completely redesign and rebuild [the resources](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/we-re-building-a-new-design-sprint-guide) that we used to educated clients and the community.

## What is a design sprint?

A Product Design Sprint is a technique to quickly design, prototype, and test the viability of an idea, product, or feature. The design sprint consists of 5 phases (typically days), starting with design thinking and ending with a user-tested prototype.

I have organised many, many design sprints over the years and found that there is no right way to plan one. Each problem is different and needs a slightly different approach.

## Phases of a design sprint

A design sprint typically has 5 phases:

- **Understand** and empathise with the problem, ask questions, and start assuming.
- **Diverge** and exhaust your imaginations for potential solutions that meet the users' needs.
- **Converge** on the best ideas, and write the test for the prototype.
- **Prototype** with just the right amount of fidelity to generate useful test results.
- **Test** the prototype and learn whatâ€™s working and what is not.

## Design sprint exercises

One of the great things about design sprints is how flexible they can be. There are lots of great exercises that as a facilitator you can use to tailor the sprint to the needs of your team.

I recommend reading [the book](https://www.thesprintbook.com) to get an idea of where to start.

## Design sprint tips and resources

- I [curated some advice](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/things-i-wish-i-had-known-before-my-first-design-sprint) from other designers on design sprints.
- I also wrote some [tips for storyboarding](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/design-sprints-storyboarding-tips) during a design sprint.
- I recommend using a scorecard for the testing phase so that you can quickly gather sentiment and take notes while talking to people.
- I also like to start with a [simple script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UXKQ1Vde84k7puhYCH5M8I1MHEsFw5EYq2kFjfQjLec/edit?usp=sharing) document to keep handy if I get stuck on questions to ask or if I need to explain anything.
